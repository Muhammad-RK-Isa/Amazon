  "description": "The first noise cancelling headphones are back, with world-class quiet, lightweight materials, and proprietary technology for deep, clear sound and adjustable EQ so you can tune your music to your liking. Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones aren’t just an icon reborn – they’re the perfect balance of quiet, comfort, and sound. Plus, everything that made the first around ear headphones an icon is still here. Just refined. Like an updated design with smooth cushions and a clean look. Plush synthetic leather, impact-resistant glass-filled nylon, and cast-metal hinges were all selected for their comfort as well as their durability. Add in minimal clamping force, and you’ll almost forget you’re wearing Bluetooth wireless noise cancelling headphones. Enhanced Acoustic Noise Cancelling™ technology produces the true quiet needed to hear every detail of your music in high fidelity. Or, choose the new Aware Mode to hear your music and your environment together. TriPort acoustic architecture and Bose's innovative Volume-optimized Active EQ add depth and clarity while maintaining balance at any volume. And lightweight materials such as synthetic leather and glass-filled nylon were meticulously selected for comfort and durability. The headphones offer 24 hours of play time*, charge via USB-C®, and feature six microphones for clearer calls. Bluetooth® 5.1 maintains a strong connection, and the Bose Music app guides you through setup, lets you personalize settings, and keeps your headphones’ software up to date.",

  "description": "The SoundLink Flex Bluetooth speaker does more than just immerse you – it provides a strong connection to your music. With crisp audio free of distortions, you’ll hear every instrument on the track and nuance in the vocals. It doesn’t matter how the portable speaker is positioned: PositionIQ technology detects its orientation and ensures the best sound. The portable Bluetooth speaker is packed with exclusive technologies. The transducer offers clear sound and deep bass. Its digital signal processing technologies, proprietary code, and custom algorithms work together for ideal sound quality wherever you are. Really, wherever, since the SoundLink Flex is an IP67 waterproof speaker. Its exterior can handle falls, the coat won’t peel or flake, and it resists corrosion and UV light. It’s also easy to hold or store, and you can secure the outdoor speaker with its utility loop. Rigorously tested to meet an IP67 rating, the SoundLink Flex is waterproof. It floats, too, so it won’t sink if it falls off your boat. For added protection from dust and debris, the Bluetooth speaker is crafted and sealed with waterproof materials. Plus, to ensure it can travel with you, Bose subjected the outdoor speaker to water, temperature, and drop tests. These proved that it’s durable enough for anything. And its battery offers up to 12 hours of unplugged play time. The Bose Connect app lets you customize the portable speaker settings, update software, and more. If your phone isn’t nearby, press and hold a button on the IP67 waterproof speaker to access your phone’s Siri or Google Assistant. A built-in microphone means you can also take and make phone calls through the SoundLink Flex. It also connects to other Bluetooth devices within 30 feet for even bigger sound.",

  "description": "Bose Sport Earbuds are designed to energize your exercise with acclaimed lifelike sound and a comfortable secure fit. Get ready to beat your personal best, again and again. Bose patented acoustic port design and premium, high-efficiency drivers combine to deliver big sound from a small acoustic package. Bose signature Volume-Optimized Active EQ automatically adjusts the bass, midrange, and treble based on how loud or soft you play your music. And Bose new StayHear Max tips create an airtight seal with your ear canal — critical for hearing the deep low notes that add impact and emotion to your music and for blocking the ambient noise around you so you can focus on your music and your workout. Bose Sport Earbuds come with three sizes of StayHear Max tips, so you can find the right fit for you. Every surface that touches your ear is made of soft silicone. Meanwhile, the unique umbrella-shaped tip and the extended flexible wing keep your Bose Sport Earbuds securely in place — without need of an ear hook — no matter how much you shake your head or jump up and down.Bose Sport Earbuds go through rigorous quality testing for durability. They’re also rated IPX4 for water resistance, which means they’re protected against sweat and light rain. The electronics inside are wrapped in special materials that protect them from moisture, so your earbuds stay in top shape, just like you. Bose Sport Earbuds feature a capacitive touch interface. On the right Earbud, tap to play or pause music and to answer calls. And on the left Earbud, double-tap to engage a Shortcut function of your choice like checking your battery level. If you get a phone call, instead of interrupting your workout, simply tap the right Earbud or press and hold it to reject. If you answer, you’ll hear the call clearly in both ears. Meanwhile, your caller will hear you clearly, too — thanks to the beam forming microphone array that separates your voice from surrounding noise.Bose Sport Earbuds provide up to 5 hours of battery life per charge. They’re charged by placing them in the included charging case. If the case is charged, it will automatically charge the earbuds. The status lights on each Earbud will pulse white, while they charge before turning solid white and then off when fully charged. When the case is fully charged, it can provide a 15-minute quick charge for up to 2 more hours or two full charges for up to 10 more hours.Bose Sport Earbuds offer complete freedom of movement. As long as you’re within 30 feet (9 meters) of your device, you’ll hear whatever you’re playing. And with Bose custom-designed antennas hidden inside each Earbud, dropouts are rare.Bose Sport Earbuds connect to the free Bose Music app, which lets you name your earbuds, set the controls the way you like them, check your battery, and more.",

The camera is the only thing interrupting the gorgeous 6.1-inch OLED display. The cameras at the back are three - the regular 12MP is joined by a 12MP telephoto and a 16MP wide-angle one, a first for the Galaxy S series.",

  "description": "Better sound begins with better silence. So Bose engineered QuietComfort Earbuds with the world-class noise cancelling and high-fidelity audio. Because when you eliminate distractions, music goes up, and so does passion. Baking. Coding. Rock climbing. And every other thing that makes you — you. Our controllable noise cancelling allows you to eliminate distractions as needed, or let in your surroundings with a full Transparency Mode. It sounds — and feels — as if you aren’t wearing earbuds at all. Better still? These truly wireless earbuds also include exclusive Volume-optimized Active EQ for high-fidelity audio that sounds full and balanced at any volume. These comfortable earbuds are easy to wear all day long because every surface that touches your ear is made of soft silicone. Instead of buttons, these true wireless earbuds feature a capacitive touch interface. Tap and press the surface to control your content — just like you would with your phone. And the instant you take a wireless earbud out of your ear, your music, podcast, or video automatically pauses so you don’t miss a second. They’re also IPX-4 rated so sweat, water, and the weather won’t get in the way of your music. Bose QuietComfort Earbuds are compatible with iOS and Android and optimized for Bluetooth 5.1 so you’ll enjoy a strong and reliable wireless signal as long as you’re within 30 feet of your paired device. On a single charge you can expect up to six hours of playback time, and the wireless charging case gives you up to 12 more hours of listening time. For your convenience, the charging case is compatible with any Qi-certified wireless charging mat (not included). Bose QuietComfort Earbuds are available in your choice of Triple Black or Soapstone. Powerful yet compact, you’ll never need to take them off.",
